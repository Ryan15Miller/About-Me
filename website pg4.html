			I also played GTA V a lot not too long ago with roughly 800 hours and a net worth of over 500 million dollars. I have everything I want in that game
			with all fo the bunkers, hangars, offices, planes, cars, a flying motorcycle, and a yaght. Another game that I have a lot of time in is World of Tanks
			which I own 70 tanks and have played 12,000 battles. A game that I haven't played for very long but am getting better at is Counter-Strike: Global Offensive 
			which is a very popular competitive game. Most of the games I play are FPS or sandbox style games.</p>
