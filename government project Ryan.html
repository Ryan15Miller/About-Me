					<dd>
						Your right of trial by jury is kept alive 
						by you being a juror. Because if no one ever 
						 showed up to the court for a hearing there

				<dt><h2>Attending School</h2></dt>
					<dd>
						Mandatory schooling creates more informed 
						and educated voters to pass better laws for everyone.

						we're so many children working in dangerous conditions while 
						they worked in factories at a very young age.
					</dd>
				<dt><h2>Paying Taxes</h2></dt>
					<dd>
						Paying taxes is required because it pays for many things to keep 
						you safe and free on a daily basis. Just some of the things it pays for is 
						a military, a police force, a fire department, and many other government 
						agencies and branches. Something else taxes pay for than an individual cannot 
						are roads that everyone can use without outrageous tolls.
