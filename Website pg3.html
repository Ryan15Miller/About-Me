			<td><p>I got my Jeep about the middle of last summer after spending the night at my friend's neighbors cottage up at silver. She showed 
            us her Jeep and mentioned they were thinking about selling it. I thought it looked in good shape so when I got home I told my family about it
            and since I've been looking for one and there was no rust on this one it seemed like a good buy. Later that summer on the fourth of July when my brother was up there 
            we went to go see the Jeep because he knows what to check before I buy it. My mom and dad were coming up for the day also. We tried calling them but they didn't respond
            until after my parents went home. My brother and offered $7500 and she accepted.<p><p>The next weekend My family went back up to pickup my new jeep. We took it for another test drive and then loaded it up
            to take it home. Once we got home we unloaded it took it for a drive and put it in the garage.</p></td>
			<td><p>We started fixing up my Jeep the weekend after we got it home. I started by cleaning it out and organizing stuff. Then I got a tachometer
            to know what the RPMs are at. We are currently tidying up the wires under the dash and rebuilding the front axle. I am going to get a better roll cage for it off of a newer Jeep.
            I also want to put a few more speakers in it and an electric radiator fan. I also need to install new axle breathers on both the front and rear. Finally, I got wheel spaces for it because the axles 
            are narrow track which means they are skinnier than a normal axle so with a 6-inch lift it might tip easier<p>
			<p>Overview of what I have done</p>
