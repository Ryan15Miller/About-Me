			<td><p>My brother and I both have Jeeps to take up to the dunes. My brother built his from our old 1997 4 cylinder manual wrangler.
                He then swapped in a chevy 383 stroker and an automatic transmission. He also lifted it and put Mickey Thompson 33" tires on it with upgraded axles.</p>
                <p>Mine is a 1979 CJ-7 that I bought last year during the summer. It has an AMC 360 engine, a fiberglass body, a 6-inch lift with 33's, and mostly everything else is stock.</p>
                <p>There are many other crazy vehicles up there from old trucks that should be in a car show to supercharged 1/2 ton sand rails with corvette engines.
                There are a lot of lifted trucks and even more Jeeps. There are many old square body trucks But the one pictured Below is my favorite out of all of them
                There is also a CJ that is aqua and chrome and it looks really nice. If I had to use one word to describe the vehicles on the dunes it would be Money.</p>

            <td><p>I have gone up to Silver Lake over ten times this summer. I spent the night four times and the rest were day trips. My brother goes up on the holidays like memorial day, the fourth, and
                labor day. That is when we rent a hotel room and stay for a long weekend.</p>
                <p>I like waking up getting breakfast and heading straight out on the dunes till the sun goes down. The More people There are and the morve vehicles you are with I think it is a lot more fun.
				The dunes on holiday weekends is always the busiest and there is a lot to watch while you are sitting letting your vehicle cool down.</p><img src="scutt doughnut.gif" alt="Doing a doughnut" width="100%"></td>
